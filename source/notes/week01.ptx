        <title>Week 1</title>
        <p>
            This week we will introduction the basics of propositional logic. 
            We will cover the following topics:
            <ul>
                <li>Propositions</li>
                <p>The basic building blocks of propositional logic 
                are propositions  
                which are statements that can be either true or false. 
                For example, "The sky is blue" is a proposition.
                do you know that the sky is blue? is not a proposition.</p>
                <li>Logical Connectives</li>
                <li>Truth Tables</li>
                <li>Logical Equivalence</li>
                <li>Implication and Equivalence</li>
            </ul>
